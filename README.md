# DATA-PROJECT


### This is a ongoing data engineering project, focusing on AWS services and ELT processes.
### I am using mixture of lambda, s3, redshift, quicksight.

### EL (done): weather data, and it's being fetched daily. It has rain, wind, temperature
### T (in progress): A dashboard and graphs to identify any relationships between the parameters. Possible to also add weather prediction!
